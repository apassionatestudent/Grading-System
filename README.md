# Grading-System

I'd like to test my skills in C# by creating a simple grading system that can calculate grades for Prelim, Midterm, and Final terms and get the overall grade. The students are then ranked according to their overall grades. The system can also create, update, and delete all without an actual database. This won't be able to store data after closing the application as I haven't dug deeper in databases just yet.
